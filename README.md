# About GDL Bot
So GDL Bot is owned and maintained by Vulcan and is running of a heavily modified instance of [red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) ~ On this code page on Gitub you will find all the cogs that I have made. If you wish to use these cogs in your instance and need assistance then please feel free to mention me on Discord. 

# About the cogs
All of the cogs that you can see on the code page are only *some* of the cogs that I have made. There are loooooads more although I am not ready to pulish them due to the fact they may not be as stable as I think. Some of the avaliable cogs will require the .json files. If you know how they all work and can read code then you will know where to put the json file. If you need any help feel free to drop me a DM on Discord and I will do my best to help you.
